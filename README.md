# Auction Website

* This is an online auction website that allows sellers to post their products with details, and schedule the auction. Buyers can buy the products by placing bids.
* The website comes with a **calendar view** using which the users can see all the deals in a calendar setting, making it easier for them to match their schedule with the auction timings. 
* Products can be sorted according to various **filters** , making it easy for buyers to grab the deals of their choice. 
* An **Auction Space** for every product allows users to see what bids are being placed for the product and various other stats while the auction is going on. 
* Buyers can view the **seller's profile** to see their *past posts* as well as *past purchases* , giving transparency and confidence. 
* There is a **watchlist** where users can add products whose auctions they wish to be notified about. An *email* will be sent to the user once the auction of that product starts. 
* The **real-time chat** feature is enabled to make communication between buyer and seller effective and effortless. 
* In the **My profile** section, the users can view and edit their details such as username/address, etc, and can also view their own past purchases as well as posts.
